## Features

- **HuggingFace Model Integration**: Seamless interaction with models hosted on HuggingFace via API tokens.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Use structured templates to guide model responses.
- **Text Generation**: Generate creative or informative text using state-of-the-art language models.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage GPU for efficient and faster model inference.
- **Model Comparison**: Test different versions of models for varied outputs.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

1. HuggingFace API token for authentication.
2. Libraries installed: 
   - `langchain`
   - `transformers`
   - `langchain-huggingface`
   - `huggingface_hub`
   - `accelerate`
   - `bitsandbytes`

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Securely fetch and use the HuggingFace API token.
2. **Model Setup**: Load and interact with pre-trained HuggingFace models.
3. **Task Execution**:
   - Generate answers to questions using structured prompts.
   - Generate text with language models like GPT-2.
4. **Optimization**: Use GPU acceleration to enhance model performance.
5. **Prompt Templates**: Use predefined templates to guide logical and systematic answers from the models.

## Key Concepts

- **Endpoints**: Connect to hosted HuggingFace models for tasks like text generation and answering queries.
- **Prompt Templates**: Create a logical flow in model outputs by defining question-answer structures.
- **Text Pipelines**: Leverage language models to generate coherent and meaningful outputs.
- **GPU Utilization**: Speed up processing with optimized pipelines and device settings.
